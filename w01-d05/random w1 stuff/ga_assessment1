#Inside which HTML Element do we put the JavaScript?
  <script>

#Where is the correct place to insert JavaScript 
   I have seen differing opinions on this. Some say the in the <head> section of an html document so that is ready once the page loads. But I think I remember that the prework said right before the closing body tag </body> near the end of the html document. I think the reasoning was that if the javascript fails the other parts of the page will at least load.
