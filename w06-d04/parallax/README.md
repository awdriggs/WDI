# Do you even parallax bro?

### Part 1

* Alter the CSS so that the picture of the clouds are behind the cats, dogs and coral sections. You are going to have to change it's positioning.

  * [Positioning](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position)
  * [Z-index](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/z-index)

### Part 2

* Add a parallax effect by changing the `bottom` property of the background div css by a factor of how far the user has scrolled. 
	HINT: Use `$(window).scrollTop()`.
* Add more parallax effects by changing the `top` property each of the images css by a different factor of how far the user has scrolled. The kittens and puppies should move.
* Have it so that the goldenrod banners are behind the kittens and puppies when they overlap, but the `h1` titles be in front of the kittens and puppies when they overlap.

### Bonus

* Play with different scroll speeds and effects!
